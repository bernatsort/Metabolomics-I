# 🧬Metabolomics-I🧬
## LC/MS metabolomics data pre-processing using xcms
- LC/MS-featured oriented metabolomics data analysis pipeline based on xcms.

### 💾Data
- Download the following data subset (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iocIVSCMTDflmRJhyvnVN5xJH3orKV_s) consisting of 4 .mzML files from human serum samples in MTBLS103 study (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS103) by (Samino et al. 2015).
- Acquisition: UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) / HILIC-based chromatography / ESI(+) mode.

### 🔬XCMS Analysis
- The xcms analysis has been performed considering on-line xcms parameters (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/landing_page.php?pgcontent=mainPage) optimized for UPLC with ~15 min gradient, high-resolution ESI-QTOF-MS (e.g. Agilent UHD Q-TOF 6538).
